We're launching Inisiatif Data (Beneran) Terbuka, a project aimed at improving access to public data in Indonesia. Our goal is to take publicly available datasets and convert them into more user-friendly formats.

## About the Project

Inisiatif Data (Beneran) Terbuka focuses on processing data from the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics (Badan Pusat Statistik), with an emphasis on economic data. We're making this information more accessible for researchers, students, and anyone interested in using public data.

## Our GitHub Repository

We've set up a GitHub repository to share our work:

1. It stores the datasets we've processed.
2. It includes a blog with updates about new datasets and project information.

## What's Available

In our repository, you'll find:

- Processed datasets in Excel (.xlsx) format
- Metadata explaining the contents of each dataset
- Instructions on how to access and download the data

## Using the Data

The datasets are available for research, academic work, and other non-commercial uses. They're licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0).

## Get Involved

If you're interested in using public data for research or other projects, we invite you to check out our repository. You can find it at [https://github.com/soegampars/idbt](https://github.com/soegampars/idbt).
